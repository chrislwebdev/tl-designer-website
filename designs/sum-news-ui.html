      alt="Sum News UI (User Interface) design part 1.  The name is stylized by joining the words sum and news with a hyphen to indicate that the news is summarized, with sum in this case being short for summary.  Sum News is an app designed to provide summarized news articles for the user, providing concise articles, an audio feature to listen to it, and video news.  The main purpose of Sum News, news summaries, is shown, and how that would look on the phone, displaying two different pages for 'saved news' and 'video news'.  The first feature outlined is to personalize and prioritize content, and it is shown how this would look on the mobile phone, with selected options marked in yellow.  For example, if the user wants to listen to health news, they can select that, which is then indicated as selected with a yellow background."
