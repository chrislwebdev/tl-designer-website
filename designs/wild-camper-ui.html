      alt="Part 1 of the UI (User Interfact) visuals and design rationale for Wild Camper.  There are two solutions outlined: browsing and choosing a location, and assistance from beginning to end.  It is shown how the app would look on the phone.  The first set of phone images shows the homepage that is offering popular routes, as well as a detailed page for that route, showing its rating and reviews from users.  The second set of phone images shows the three different stages, with each having a different color to easily distinguish between them.  Charging for the next route is a light pastel orange, preparing for the next route is a light pastel blue, and on the way is a pastel green.  The app also has different features, including routes, contacts, reviews, maps, reminders, checklists, and settings."

It is also shown how this would look on the phone.  The first set of phone images show the map feature, detailing how the user can mark locations, as well as how those maps can be downloaded for offline use.  Additionally, it shows how different types of camping are offered and their locations, which includes RV parks, tent camping locations, glamping locations, and beach camping locations.
