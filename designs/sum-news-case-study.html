      alt="Part 3 of the UX (User Experience) case study for Sum News.  A woman is shown browsing her phone and looking calm and relaxed.  Next to that image of her, the words that the Sum News app is aiming for are shown, which are customized, curated prioritized, convenient, and limited exposure.  The research phase is shown, which includes the secondary research findings.  The hypothesis of the designer was that people are being exposed to excessive amounts of news, and this is supported with a static from the Pew Research Center in 2017, which found that 62% of American adults felt overwhelmed with the amount of news they had to keep up with.  More research is shown, with the Reuters Institute reporting in 2020 that 37% of repondents in the United Kingdom felt overwhelmed by the amount of news and information available.  The average profiles of news consumers are outlined next, which are people who are over 50, have a higher level of education, a higher level of income, and people who identify as conservative or liberal, rather than moderate.  It is said that, on average, that people who follow the news spend 30 minutes consuming it.  Next, questions from the primary research findings are shown.  In the response to whether or not people feel affected by too much news exposure, a bar is colored mostly yellow and includes the response of, yes, I feel affected by news overload.  In response to other questions, the research shows that the biggest problem with the news is that people don't find it trustworthy, more people follow digital media sources, more people watch or listen to the news instead of reading it, and that the majority of people would want to customize, prioritize and limit their news."

      alt="Part 4 of the UX (User Experience) case study for Sum News.  There is a title for common pain points, under which the image of a woman wearing headphones, looking slightly pensive, and looking at her phone is shown.  There is a list of three pain points, which includes articles being too long, seeing too many pop-up ads and not being able to navigtate without hindrance, and having way too much irrelevant news on the home page.  The next title is common user goals, under which the same woman is seen actively using her phone.  The common user goals outlined are, wanting to get informed without harassment, wanting to read, watch or listen to only relevant news, and being able to learn the gist of the news in a short time.  Next, design directions are outlined, which is for people to be informed in a concise manner and be able to customize and prioritize the content.  Next, the information architecture is shown, which details how the user will navigate the app.  For example, from the home news feed, they can user different features like the top tab or bottom tap, or navigtate to different sections, such as their news page, trending news, and single news articles.  The image finishes by showing the style guide and UX (User Experience) kit, which shows the three colors of the app and how things will be spaced on the mobile screen.  The colors are a soft yellow, a pastel grey, and a very dark brown.  Finally, all of the buttons and icons for the app are shown, which include the play button, pause button, back button, save button, and icons for things like alerts, bookmarking and liking."
