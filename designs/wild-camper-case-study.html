      alt="Part 1 of the UX case study for Wild Camper.  A new application that aims to be the camper's new best friend in nature.  Every year, millions of people go camping in nature, but they don't always anticipate problems they may encounter on their journeys, such as bad weather, equipment issues, encounters with the local wildlife, dehydration, and so on.  This case study outlines why the Wild Camper app would help with all of those problems.  Its solutions include: browsing and choosing locations based on detailed information, assistance from beginning to end, location-based preparation, real-time reminders and warnings, GPS marking and offline maps, and SOS messages.  With all of these, the camper will be better prepared and, most importantly, able to enjoy their experience in the great outdoors."

      alt="Part 2 of the UX case study for Wild Camper.  This image asks the question, do we really need Wild Camper?  The research shows that the vast majority of camping incidents are related to factors like fitness, campfire safety, wildlife and insects, weather conditions, and terrain issues.  Some of the research conducted is displayed, including surveys with members of an outdoor forum.  For example, 8/10 campers think the most important assessment is either a realistic fitness assessment, skill assessment, or camping priorities assessment.  The research also found that their biggest expectations from such an app would be to put GPS markings on maps, use maps offline, see facilities close by and road conditions, connect with other campers, send SOS messages, and take pictures."

It is shown how the app would look on the phone.  The first set of phone images shows the homepage that is offering popular routes, as well as a detailed page for that route, showing its rating and reviews from users.  The second set of phone images shows the three different stages, with each having a different color to easily distinguish between them.  Charging for the next route is a light pastel orange, preparing for the next route is a light pastel blue, and on the way is a pastel green.  The app also has different features, including routes, contacts, reviews, maps, reminders, checklists, and settings."
